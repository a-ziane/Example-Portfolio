## 🛠️ Core Frontend Skills Demonstrated

This project is structured to showcase a wide range of essential frontend competencies.

### **1. Advanced CSS3 & Design**
- **Theming & Variables:** Reusable color scheme using CSS Variables for quick palette swaps and easy maintenance.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Built with modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for a clean, adaptable layout across all screen sizes.  
- **Aesthetics:** Complex gradients, depth-creating box shadows, and elegant `backdrop-filter` usage produce a premium UI style.

### **2. Animations and Interactivity**
- **Performance-Optimized Animations:** Smooth, GPU-accelerated transitions using `transform` and `opacity`.  
- **CSS Keyframe Animations:** Includes custom animations like `textGlow` (luminous text) and `pulseBorder` (section emphasis).  
- **CSS Transitions:** Fluid, controlled transitions applied to navigation, buttons, and portfolio cards.

### **3. Vanilla JavaScript for UX & Performance**
- **Intersection Observer API:** Triggers skill bar animations only when the section enters the viewport for optimal performance.  
- **Dynamic DOM Interaction:** Reads HTML `data-level` attributes to dynamically animate skill bar widths.
